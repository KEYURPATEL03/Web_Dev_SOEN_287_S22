    <p>The first direct detection of gravitational waves is without doubt one of the most remarkable breakthroughs
        of our time. The advanced LIGO laboratories in the US states of Washington and Louisiana have traced the
        warping of space from the merger of two black holes about 1.3 billion light-years from earth.
