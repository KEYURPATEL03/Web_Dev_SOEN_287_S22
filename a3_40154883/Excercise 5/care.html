            <h2>Take the Time to Train Your Dog/Cat</h2>
            Being a responsible canine pet parent means taking responsibility for training your dog.<br>
            Obedience training not only helps instill healthy doggy manners, but it also plays a big role in keeping your dog happy, 
            healthy and safe.

            <h2>Make Time For Engaging Playtime</h2>
            Playtime is an essential part of building and strengthening the bond between you and your pet.<br>
             It allows you to establish a fun and positive relationship with your pet while also providing them with a productive outlet for their energy.<br>
             As a responsible pet owner, you should set aside time to spend each day actively playing with your pet.

            <h2>Take Your Dog/Cat on Daily Walks</h2>
            Every dog needs regular walks—but how often and how long depends on the dog. <br>
            There are dogs that may only enjoy short walks to do their business and then want to head back inside, and there are other dogs that may need to go for longer runs to burn off all their energy.
            

            <h2>Clean Up After Your Pet</h2>
            As a pet owner, you’re responsible for your pet and the messes they make.<br>
            When you’re walking your dog, always make sure to have dog poop bags on hand to pick up any mess he leaves behind on the sidewalk or in a neighbor’s lawn. 
            <br>There are plenty of dog poop bag dispensers available that can be attached directly to your dog’s leash, so there is no excuse to not pick up after your pup.

            <h2>Take Them for Routine Veterinary Checkups</h2>
            As a pet owner, you’re responsible for your pet’s health, which includes regular veterinary care.<br>
            If you have a senior dog or cat, it is recommended to make appointments with your veterinarian every six months.
